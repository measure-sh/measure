# SDK Upgrade Guides

This directory contains upgrade guides for the SDKs. This contains detailed information about any breaking changes or
behavior changes that you should be aware of when upgrading to a new version of the SDK. The guides are only
created for versions that have non-trivial breaking changes or behavior changes. For minor releases that do not have
any breaking changes or behavior changes, we recommend checking the release notes for more details.
