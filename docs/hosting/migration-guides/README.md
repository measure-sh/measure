# Migration Guides

Use these guides when upgrading to newer versions of Measure that requires some additional configurations, like one time data maintenance operations. For the usual upgrade process, [follow this guide](../../hosting/README.md#upgrade-a-self-hosted-installation).

Some migrations may contain _optional_ steps. The specific guide would state that clearly.
