## Introduction

Custom events let you add your own context on top of the automatically collected events. Theyâ€™re great for tracking things that matter to your app, like user actions, feature usage, feature flags, or any other domain-specific data. This helps you debug issues more effectively and analyze the real-world impact of your features.

> [!TIP]
>
> Some events like Screen View and Handled errors/exceptions can be tracked using dedicated methods. This allows you to maintain a consistent structure for common events, making them easier to search and analyze.

## Custom Events in Session Timeline

Custom events are included in the [Session Timeline](feature-session-monitoring.md#session-timeline) along with other automatically collected events. The event and its attributes can be viewed in the timeline, making it easy to get context on what happened during a session.

## API Reference

### Track a Custom Event

To track a custom event, use the `trackEvent` method.

#### Android

```kotlin
Measure.trackEvent("event_name")
```

#### iOS

Using Swift:

```swift
Measure.shared.trackEvent(name: "event_name")
```

Using ObjC:

```objc
[[Measure shared] trackEvent:@"event_name"];
```

### Custom Event Attributes

A custom event can also contain attributes, which are key-value pairs.

> [!NOTE]
> - Attribute keys must be strings with a maximum length of `256` characters.
> - Attribute values must be one of the primitive types: `int`, `long`, `double`, `float`, or `boolean`.
> - String attribute values can have a maximum length of `256` characters.

#### Android

```kotlin
val attributes = AttributesBuilder()
    .put("is_premium_user", true)
    .build()
Measure.trackEvent("event_name", attributes = attributes)
```

#### iOS

Using Swift:

```swift
Measure.shared.trackEvent(name: "event_name", attributes: ["is_premium_user": .bool(true)])
```

Using ObjC:

```objc
[[Measure shared] trackEvent:@"event_name" attributes:@{@"is_premium_user": YES}];
```

### Custom Event with Timestamp

You can also record a custom event with a specific timestamp. This is useful for tracking events that happened before the SDK was initialized, like events during app startup. The timestamp should be in milliseconds since epoch.

#### Android

```kotlin
Measure.trackEvent("event_name", timestamp = 1734443973879L)
```

#### iOS

Using Swift:

```swift
Measure.shared.trackEvent(name: "event_name", timestamp: 1734443973879)
```

Using ObjC:

```objc
[[Measure shared] trackEvent:@"event_name" timestamp:1734443973879];
```
