# Data retention

To control the amount of data stored on the server, measure-sh provides options to limit the time for which data is
retained. This helps balance data quality with storage costs, giving complete control to you over how long you want to
retain the data.

When you create a new app in the measure-sh dashboard, you can set the data retention period. The default is 90 days, 
but you can choose any period starting from minimum 7 days to maximum 365 days.

You can also modify the data retention period later from the app settings in the dashboard.
