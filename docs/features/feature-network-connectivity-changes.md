# Network Connectivity Changes

* [**Android**](#android)
* [**iOS**](#ios)]
* [**Data collected**](#data-collected)

Measure SDK captures changes to network connection state of the device. This includes changes to the type of network
connection (WiFi, Mobile, etc.), the network provider (Airtel, T-Mobile, etc.), and the network generation (2G, 3G, 4G,
etc.).

## Android

> [!NOTE]  
> The SDK does not add any new permissions to the app. It only uses the permissions that the app already has.
> Network connection state change feature is only enabled if the necessary permissions are already granted
> to the app.

Measure monitors changes in network. It is enabled only when the app is granted the
ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permission and the device is running on Android M (SDK 23) or a higher version.
Measure does not add any new permissions to the app. It only uses the permissions that the app already has.

Tracking of [network_generation] is limited to Cellular network for Android M (SDK 23) and later.
This requires the app to hold the [READ_PHONE_STATE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_PHONE_STATE)
permission, which is a runtime permission. In case the user denies this permission, network generation will not be captured. For devices running
Android Tiramisu (SDK 33) or later, [READ_BASIC_PHONE_STATE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_BASIC_PHONE_STATE)
permission is sufficient, and it does not require a runtime permission.

## iOS

To detect network changes, Measure relies on NWPathMonitor's `pathUpdateHandler`. The `pathUpdateHandler` provides a callback whenever the network changes between cellular and Wi-Fi. Additionally, we perform independent checks to detect if the connection is accessed via VPN or if no internet is available. We rely on `CTTelephonyNetworkInfo` to get carrier information.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Starting from iOS 16.4, access to the `network_provider` is no longer available and will be removed in a future 
> release of the SDK.
