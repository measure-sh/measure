## Measure helps you get to the root cause

- Capture Crashes and ANRs automatically.
- Monitor app health metrics such as launch times, error rates and app sizes.
- View event timelines of error sessions with auto-tracked user clicks, navigation events, http calls, cpu usage, memory usage and more for deeper debugging context.
- Allow your users to send bug reports via SDK call or device shake.
- Optimize performance with traces.
- Visualize user navigations through your app.
- Track custom events with additional business specific attributes.
- Dynamically adjust data collection parameters without needing to roll out app updates.
- Self-Host for full data privacy or use [Measure Cloud](https://measure.sh) for convenience.

## Quick start

Measure is available as a self-hosted platform that comes with a simple one line install script. Check out our [Self hosting](./docs/hosting/README.md) and [SDK integration](./docs/sdk-integration-guide.md) guides.

## Features

### App Health

Monitor important metrics to stay on top of [app health](https://measure.sh/product/app-health). Quickly see deltas to make sure you're moving in the right direction.

### Session Timelines

Debug issues easily with [session timelines](https://measure.sh/product/session-timelines). Get the complete context with automatic tracking for clicks, navigations, http calls and more.

### Crashes and ANRs

Automatically track [Crashes and ANRs](https://measure.sh/product/crashes-and-anrs). Dive deeper with screenshots, filters and detailed stacktraces

### Performance Traces

Analyze [app performance](https://measure.sh/product/performance-traces) with traces and spans. Break down complex issues and intelligently smoothen out bottlenecks.

### Bug Reports

Capture [bug reports](https://measure.sh/product/bug-reports) with a device shake or SDK call. Get full history of user actions leading to the bug.

### User Journeys

Understand how [users move](https://measure.sh/product/user-journeys) through your app. Easily visualise screens most affected by issues.

### Adaptive Capture

[Dynamically adjust](https://measure.sh/product/adaptive-capture) data collection parameters without needing to roll out app updates. Turn up data collection during a new release and turn it down to save on storage and costs when things are running smoothly.

## Philosophy

Our mission is to build the best tool for monitoring mobile apps in production. 

Building performant mobile apps is hard. Monitoring and debugging them in production is harder.

Developers need to use a variety of different tools to debug issues, measure performance and analyse user behavior which leads to critical time being wasted during production incidents. 

We aim to build a tool that helps developers stop stitching context and get to the root cause while having full control over data storage via self-hosting or using our hosted [Measure Cloud](https://measure.sh).

We operate in public as much as possible and we aim to be community focused and driven by feedback from real developers building in the trenches.

We would love for you to contribute to Measure by opening issues, sending PRs and recommending us to your fellow developers!
