/// Represents a unit of work or operation within a trace.
///
/// A span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be nested to form
/// a trace tree that represents the end-to-end execution path of an operation.
/// Each span captures timing data, status, parent-child relationships to provide context
/// about the operation.
///
/// Example:
/// ```
/// let span = Measure.shared.startSpan("load_data")
/// do {
///     // perform work
///     span.setCheckpoint("checkpoint")
///     span.setStatus(.ok)
/// } catch {
///     span.setStatus(.error)
/// } finally {
///     span.end()
/// }
/// ```
