# Feature - App Exit Info

Added in API level 30 (Android 11) in Android SDK, app exit info provides insight into why the application process was
killed. Application process could die for many reasons, including LOW_MEMORY, CRASH, ANR, etc. Along with the reason it
also provides information
about [importance](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.RunningAppProcessInfo#constants_1)
of the process at the time of death.

App Exit Info can also contain stack traces if the reason for process death is an ANR. This trace contains information
about the threads and their state at the time of ANR. A sample snippet from a trace:

```
"main" prio=5 tid=1 Blocked
  at sh.measure.sample.ExceptionDemoActivity.deadLock$lambda$10(ExceptionDemoActivity.kt:66)
  - waiting to lock <0x0a293e9f> (a java.lang.Object) held by thread 22
  at sh.measure.sample.ExceptionDemoActivity.$r8$lambda$kc26SdTV_Hqz6i5PLOpVXKS016U(unavailable:0)
  at sh.measure.sample.ExceptionDemoActivity$$ExternalSyntheticLambda9.run(unavailable:2)
  at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:942)
  at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99)
  at android.os.Looper.loopOnce(Looper.java:201)
  at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:288)
  at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:7872)
  at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native method)
  at com.android.internal.os.RuntimeInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(RuntimeInit.java:548)
  at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:936)


"APP: Locker" prio=5 tid=22 Sleeping
  at java.lang.Thread.sleep(Native method)
  - sleeping on <0x06290e31> (a java.lang.Object)
  at java.lang.Thread.sleep(Thread.java:450)
  - locked <0x06290e31> (a java.lang.Object)
  at java.lang.Thread.sleep(Thread.java:355)
  at sh.measure.sample.ExceptionDemoActivity.sleep(ExceptionDemoActivity.kt:86)
  at sh.measure.sample.ExceptionDemoActivity.access$sleep(ExceptionDemoActivity.kt:12)
  at sh.measure.sample.ExceptionDemoActivity$LockerThread.run(ExceptionDemoActivity.kt:80)
  - locked <0x0a293e9f> (a java.lang.Object)
```

Notice that the "main" thread is blocked and is "waiting to lock" held by "thread 22" and the state of `tid=22` shows
that this thread is in "Sleeping" state. This means that main thread is blocked on this thread which is likely the root
cause of the ANR. The stack trace for tid=22 also indicates that this thread has an explicit Thread.sleep method which
lead this deadlock to occur, leading to an ANR.

> [!NOTE]  
> Starting from API 31, for Native crashes, App Exit Info contains
> the [tombstone](https://source.android.com/docs/core/tests/debug) stack trace. Support for native crash reports is
> not yet implemented and will be coming soon. Track the
> updates [here](https://github.com/measure-sh/measure/issues/103).

## How it works

App exit info is read
from [ActivityManager.getHistoricalProcessExitReasons](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/app/ActivityManager#gethistoricalprocessexitreasons)
and sent to the Measure server.

Note that App Exit Info is generated by the system and is stored in a ring buffer, there can be cases where App Exit
Info for a process has been cleared out before we had a chance to send it to Measure.

section.
