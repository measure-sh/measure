# Measure Android Gradle Plugin

* Uploads mapping files generated by proguard/R8 to Measure. This happens automatically for
  all `assemble` tasks for variants that have `minifyEnabled` set to `true`.
* To upload mapping files for a specific variant manually.
  run `./gradlew upload<variant_name>ProguardMappingToMeasure`. This task triggers a minify task for
  the variant and then uploads the mapping file to Measure.
