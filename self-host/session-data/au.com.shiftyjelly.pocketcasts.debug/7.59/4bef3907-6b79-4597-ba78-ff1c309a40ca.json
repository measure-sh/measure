They also discuss how ‚Äúdesigning for one‚Äù when it comes to inclusive design leads to innovative solutions and what they learned about optimizing these types of systems for real-world use (spoiler: it‚Äôs not necessarily more or higher-quality data).</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/taix/overview/\\\">Teachable AI Experiences (Tai X)</a> | Project page</li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/understanding-personalized-accessibility-through-teachable-ai-designing-and-evaluating-find-my-things-for-people-who-are-blind-or-low-vision/\\\">Understanding Personalized Accessibility through Teachable AI: Designing and Evaluating Find My Things for People who are Blind or Low Vision</a> | Publication, October 2023</li><li><a href=\\\"https://inclusive.microsoft.design/\\\">Microsoft Inclusive Design</a> | Inclusive design resource center</li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.deafblindeverestproject.com/\\\">DeafBlind Everest Project</a> | Karolina (Caroline)¬†Pakƒónaitƒó personal website</li></ul>\",\"hash\":\"333ece8b14aae3fb532603885210c688\",\"modified\":1701794357,\"transcripts\":[]},{\"uuid\":\"04df9a8f-de04-4438-a880-af63c7227ea2\",\"title\":\"Abstracts: November 20, 2023\",\"url\":\"https://media.blubrry.com/microsoftresearch/content.blubrry.com/microsoftresearch/MSR_Abstracts_Shrey_Zoe_FINAL.mp3\",\"published\":\"2023-11-20T14:10:00Z\",\"show_notes\":\"<p>Members of the research community at Microsoft work continuously to advance their respective fields. <em>Abstracts</em> brings its audience to the cutting edge with them through short, compelling conversations about new and noteworthy achievements.</p><p>In this episode, <a href=\\\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shreyjain/\\\">Shrey Jain</a>, a Technical Project Manager at Microsoft Research, and <a href=\\\"http://www.zoehitzig.com/\\\">Dr. Zo√´ Hitzig</a>, a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows, discuss their work on <em>contextual confidence</em>, which presents a framework to understand and more meaningfully address the increasingly sophisticated challenges generative AI poses to communication.</p><p><a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01193\\\">Read the paper</a></p>\",\"hash\":\"fea776eed808c080dd58b01ebef65f2d\",\"modified\":1700491229,\"image\":\"https://assets.blubrry.com/coverart/episode/506874/orig/122434796-1700251235.jpg\",\"transcripts\":[]},{\"uuid\":\"c3d73949-c593-4887-8525-7dc14257075d\",\"title\":\"What‚Äôs Your Story: Desney Tan\",\"url\":\"https://media.blubrry.com/microsoftresearch/content.blubrry.com/microsoftresearch/WYS_Desney_V4_FINAL_11_13_.mp3\",\"published\":\"2023-11-16T14:20:00Z\",\"show_notes\":\"<p>In this new Microsoft Research Podcast series <em>What‚Äôs Your Story</em>, Johannes Gehrke explores the <em>who</em> behind the technical and scientific advancements helping to reshape the world.

They also discuss supporting clinician productivity‚Äîand ultimately patient outcomes‚Äîand the important role patients play in incorporating AI into healthcare.</p><p><strong>Learn more:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/medical-image-analysis/\\\">Project InnerEye</a> | Project page</li><li><a href=\\\"https://news.microsoft.com/en-gb/2023/06/27/ai-helping-shrink-waiting-times-nhs-cancer-patients/\\\">How AI is helping to shrink waiting times for NHS cancer patients</a> | Microsoft News Centre UK blog post, June 2023</li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/accounting-for-past-imaging-studies-enhancing-radiology-ai-and-reporting/\\\">Accounting for past imaging studies: Enhancing radiology AI and reporting</a> | Microsoft Research blog, June 2023</li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-health-futures/\\\">Microsoft Health Futures</a> | Lab page</li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/biomedical-imaging/\\\">Biomedical Imaging</a> | Research group page</li><li><a href=\\\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/evaluation-of-deep-learning-to-augment-image-guided-radiotherapy-for-head-and-neck-and-prostate-cancers/\\\">Evaluation of Deep Learning to Augment Image Guided Radiotherapy for Head and Neck and Prostate Cancers</a> | JAMA publication, November 2020</li></ul>\",\"hash\":\"25187a37a4823a7237e19a2ddebcb2e1\",\"modified\":1700146234,\"image\":\"https://assets.blubrry.com/coverart/episode/506874/orig/114624219-1695745420.jpg\",\"transcripts\":[]},{\"uuid\":\"3bd40b21-70e5-4542-8b3c-8ca03b8dbdb1\",\"title\":\"Collaborators: Data-driven decision-making with Jina Suh and Shamsi Iqbal\",\"url\":\"https://media.blubrry.com/microsoftresearch/content.blubrry.com/microsoftresearch/MSR_Collaborators_Ep5_Mix1l4_8_m18_2_Final2.mp3\",\"published\":\"2023-08-03T13:00:00Z\",\"show_notes\":\"<p>Transforming research ideas into meaningful impact is no small feat.
