# Measure Android Gradle Plugin

* Uploads mapping files generated by proguard/R8 to Measure. This happens automatically for all `assemble` tasks for
  build types
  that have `minifyEnabled` set to `true`.
* To upload mapping files for a specific build type manually,
  run `./gradlew upload<variant_name>ProguardMappingToMeasure`. This task triggers a minify task for the variant and
  then uploads the mapping file to Measure.
