# Benchmark Data

This directory contains benchmarks collected by running the macro-benchmarks
at [benchmark](../benchmark). Each sub-directory contains the results of the benchmarks in json 
format, as provided by Android macro-benchmark library.

Each file is named using the data it was collected for. The statup benchmark results are collected
for both `measureDisabled` and `measureEnabled` flavors. While the target finder benchmark results
are collected with `measureEnabled` flavor only.
